Standardized Sales Adjustment Templates - One stop shop for KCP stakeholders,"Executive Summary
Several requests are submitted†daily to the KCP CFS sales adjustment mailbox from other CFS members along with KCP business unit stake holders (Sales).† These requests are not standardized resulting in unnecessary amount of time by requester and processer to align on the necessary†information.† This idea develops standardized templates along with a simple mechanism (Excel file with macro powered radial buttons) to deploy the templates to the stakeholders.† This file is built leveraging the skills of two KCP CFS Chargeback team members further allowing synergies to be harnessed by the KCP CFS Order Settlement and Chargeback Teams.††??

?Detailed Description
?Within the KCP CFS sales adjustment mailbox, the two team members assigned to it†are experiencing difficulty†managing the requests against a 48-hour turnaround window.† Additionally, these two team members are working additional hours to attempt to keep up with demand.†
A review of the overall process was conducted and identified a lack of a standardized process in which the requests were submitted resulting in unnecessary time interpreting the received request.† Five standardized templates were developed based on the common types of requests received along with the necessary information required to quickly process the request.†
 In order to allow for ease of deployment of the five templates†to stakeholders, two KCP CFS Chargeback team members with advanced macro building skills developed an Excel based file.† This file houses simple radial buttons that the stakeholder can select which will automatically populate the desired template into an Outlook email message that will populate directly the sales adjustment mailbox.††
?The stakeholder can then fill in the requested information and click send on the email.†This will result in a uniform and standardized process for both the KCP stakeholder and the two KCP CFS team members processing the requests.
Once these new standardized templates are rolled out, we plan to identify†additional activities within CFS†that we would further explore mirroring similar functionality. Examples include miscellaneous invoice creation and miscellaneous billing requests.†????

Optimizing Source-to-Pay Process Using Celonis Process Copilot," The S2P process is the backbone of procurement within organizations.

- It encompasses a series of interconnected steps, from identifying suppliers to finalizing payments.

- Efficient S2P directly impacts cost control, supplier relationships, and overall business performance.

?

Challenges Faced by S2P

- Inefficiencies: Manual processes, redundant steps, and delays hinder the flow of S2P.

- Compliance Issues: Ensuring adherence to procurement policies, regulations, and ethical standards is complex.

- Delays: Slow approvals, lengthy requisition cycles, and payment bottlenecks affect operational agility.
- This project aims to enhance S2P efficiency by leveraging Celonis' Process Copilot.

- Process Copilot combines **process mining** (analyzing event logs) with **natural language interaction**.

- By doing so, it democratizes process insights, making them accessible to business analysts, procurement professionals, and other stakeholders.

?How Process Copilot Helps

Natural Language Queries: Users can ask questions in plain language (e.g., ""Show me average time from requisition to order approval"").

Actionable Insights: Process Copilot responds with relevant data, charts, and recommendations.

Root Cause Analysis: Investigate process bottlenecks and deviations.

Continuous Improvement: Optimize S2P based on insights gained.","Streamlined Process: By analyzing historical event logs, Process Copilot will identify bottlenecks, deviations, and areas for improvement within the S2P process.

Actionable Insights: Stakeholders will gain actionable insights through natural language queries, enabling faster decision-making.

Improved Supplier Relationships: Timely approvals and reduced cycle times will enhance relationships with suppliers.
Cost Savings: Estimated annual savings of $250,000 due to reduced processing time and optimized workflows.

Reduced Late Payments: A 20% reduction in late payments, resulting in avoided penalties and improved supplier satisfaction.

Efficiency Gains: 15% reduction in manual effort, leading to increased productivity.

?Currently, for the non-mobile EEs payroll gets reports via email. Which means that the Comp&Ben team must be aware of any personal changes that might happen in the payroll team. The report is in USD, so the payroll team needs to convert it into local currency first. The report contains gross LTI bonus and Withheld tax. So the following step for payroll team is to count the amount that was already paid to the EE. The employee then sees the LTI only in the pay slip, it cannot be checked anywhere else because the report is available only to payroll. 
?
?What if Comp&Ben team instead of sendting the report via email to payroll, would create a request for the LTI bonus and the amount that was already paid out were both put into Workday in local currency? So the EE could check the amount in WD and see the same amount in the pay slip. So Comp&Ben team would't have to track whom to send the report.

?As for the mobile EEs, payroll gets notification if there is any update in the EquityService provided by EY. In that case payroll signs in the system, downloads the report.
